#What is SPCodeColorer?
Editors and technical writers who work with SharePoint often need to insert pieces of source code into pages. Usually, they have to use external tools for syntax highlighting. SPCodeColorer allows to get highlighed code without switching to any other application or site. It works in its own dialog box accessible by clicking a button on the Ribbon.
