[Icons]
- Redesign main icon
- Find an icon to place on the Ribbon

[Three areas]
1. Input area for the code (plain-text)
2. Preview with colored code
3. HTML view
How to display this areas?
- One below another (mobile friendly?)
- One "under" another, allowing to switch between views by usung tabs, for example

[Limits?]
- Source code size in bytes/characters?
- Final code size?
- JS-library limits?
- SharePoint limits? (e.g. WikiContent field)

[User actions]
- Insert source code (Ctrl+V, paste)
- Preview
- Copy to clipboard: rich-text
- Copy to clipboard: HTML
- Cancel/Close

[Two ways to grab the code]
- Copy from Preview as rich-text that can be pasted with OOB WYSIWYG functionality
- Copy as HTML code to paste into page's source code (advanced scenario?)

Do we need to prepare the source code somehow? For example, smart quotes, autoindent, etc. Maybe JS-library can do it already.

Frameworks & libraries: jQuery, Office UI Fabric, ClipboardJS, HighlightJS

! Localization

Do we need to wrap HTML-version of generated code with <code> tag?

[Add-in configuration page]
- Do we need it at all? Do we have any options to configure out of main window of the add-in?
- Who can configure the add-in? Website admins?
- How to implement: dedicated page.
  BTW, Default.aspx is quite a good option: we can show help/how-to on the page for all users, adding "Configure" link for admins only.
  Of course Admin.aspx should also check if user has web administrator rights on the site.
